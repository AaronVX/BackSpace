### Purpose

The purpose of BackSpace is to easily allow you to book spaceflight tickets.
This is essentially a makeover on a airplane ticket purchase app, which was one of the projects suggested.
The space element was just to make the project a little more interesting.
The app allows you to easily look at ongoing flights, book a flight with all options that go along with that, and look at the possible destinations.

### How to Run

To Run the project simply build as a project and install the APK to the android device.
